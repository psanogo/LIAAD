Formatting requirements

As the Cloud Setup is ready with the APIs, you need to make sure the conversation data is in the required format. Conversation data must be uploaded as a Google Cloud Storage Bucket and received as a JSON or csv file. If provided using Google Drive, unzip, and upload to Google Cloud Storage Bucket storage under customerâ€™s cloud project.

Each entry should be formatted as follows:

It must have Transcript ID, Role, Content, user ID and Timestamp. 

The Transcript ID is a unique identifier for every conversation. This is used to store the conversation in the file named as Transcript ID dash dot dash JSON.

Role is the actor in the conversation.  It may be an AGENT or CUSTOMER.

Messages in the conversation are stored as values to text key.  

user_id is a unique number that identifies the conversation participant.

The timestamp of every message is stored in the key start_timestamp_usec.

  "conversation_info": {

      "text": "Hello, I'm calling in regards to ...",
      "role": "CUSTOMER",
